# mypokemon
Test Project

## How App Work
- Display List Pokemons
- View Detail a Pokemon
- Catch Pokemon with 50% success chance
- Display Catched Pokemon list
- Release Pokemon with function to get random number, if the number returned by the API
  is not a prime number, then release will fail and vice versa
- Rename Catched Pokemon with fibonacci sequence to add number in name
  eg : 
  • First name assigned is “Mighty Pikachu”, first time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-0”
  • Second time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-1”
  • Third time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-1”
  • Fourth time renamed should be: “Mighty Pikachu-2”, and so on.
